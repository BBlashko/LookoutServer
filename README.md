# LookoutServer

To setup this server on a Ubuntu OS follow the steps in the Install_LookoutBluetoothServer.txt file.

The information in the file contains both the data to be put into files, and all the commands starting from the top and ending at the bottom.
Once setup the server will be automatically started on boot, and if it fails.
